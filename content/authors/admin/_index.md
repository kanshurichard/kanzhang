I am a travel writer from China and have been travelling the world since 2016.In 2018, I bought a second-hand car in the Republic of Georgia and started my #drive2world project. So far, a total of 95 countries and regions in Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America have been reached. I have established partnerships with many well-known travel media in China and around the world and have been a long-time contributor to them, including Lonely Planet.
